## Background

Make no mistake about it, any great Adobe Analytics implementation will leverage a countless number
of customizations that best fit the individual needs of the organization. But at the same time, there are a set of core guidelines and best practices that can be followed for Adobe Analytics implementations that will help yield powerful analytical insights straight out of the box.

This project was created to help promote solid implementations as a foundational starting point. Because good, clean, and accessible data elements allow us all to become more insightful. Most of what is included can be taken generically across a variety of verticals, but keep in mind there are also an expanded set of best practices relevant to specific industries (for example: travel, media, and retail organizations will tend to focus on different performance metrics).

If you have any suggestions to improve what should be included in a solid basic (and general) implementation, I invite you to participate in this project.


## Implementation

It is highly recommended to implement a [W3C compliant data layer](https://www.w3.org/community/custexpdata/) and implement any Analytics tags through the use of a Tag Management System (TMS).
